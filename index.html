					<span>1908 - The Ford Model T</span> 
				</div>	
					<p>
						The car is one of the most important and influential inventions in the modern age. Thanks to the Model T, the first mass-produced car, transportation became fast, convenient and yet affordable. Prior to the Model T, cars were expensive and only available to those with the luxury to afford them. However, Ford’s use of the moving assembly line reduced the need for manpower while greatly increasing the rate of production. This allowed Ford to pass savings from the production on to their customers and significantly cut down on the prices of the Model T. During 19 years of production, over 15 million Model T’s were sold. Both the Model T and the moving assembly line that they were built on were important and revolutionary ideas that set the stage for the modern age of automobiles.

				</div>	
					<p>
						As time went on, people’s taste in cars began to change. They wanted something that was more than just a car. They wanted style, speed, and luxury. Thus, the production of the Model T was discontinued and in its place, legends in the automobile world were born. This extensive list includes the <a href="gt40.html">Ford GT40</a>, <a href="f1.html">McLaren F1</a>, the Porsche 911 series, Ferrari 250 GTO, Nissan GTRs, and <a href="rx7.html">Mazda RX7</a>. Not only are they some of the fastest and best-looking cars ever, they are also icons in pop culture, ever present in films, videogames and music. From the Cars movie to the Fast and Furious franchise, these are names that many would recognize, even if they aren’t much of a car person.

					<h2>Climate Change</h2>
				</div>	
					<p>
						Regrettably, these beautiful machines are also some of the biggest contributors to the growing climate change problem. All cars with combustion engines need fuel to run. When fuel is burned, cars release millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which are both toxic to breathe and trap heat, accelerating the climate change process. However, they have already become an essential part of our lives, making the most viable solution to this growing problem electric cars. The battery based electric car releases practically 0 direct emissions, leading to a greener and more sustainable future. However, having an electric engine also removes a lot of the charms of a car, such as the engine sounds, feeling of shifting and even driving itself. So, do the environmental benefits of the electric car outweigh the appeal of the traditional car to car fans all around the world?
