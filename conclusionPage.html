					<p>
						The electric car is undoubtedly the future of transportation. The Tesla Model S Plaid is enough proof of this, an indicator of just how far things can be taken. While many electric cars are currently overshadowed by the traditional petrol car, technology will drastically progress in the next 10 years, and so will the electric car. In fact, many of the largest car manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, General Motors, and Toyota, have planned to mostly or only build electric cars by 2030. Gas cars might even be obsolete and extinct in another twenty years. Most of the current electric cars share a similar SUV look, losing the charm and individuality of the many classics out there. Still, at least they look like the cars that we know, but the same cannot be said for some future electric “cars”, such as the Aptera Sol. While this might be bad news for fellow petrol heads out there, it is undeniable that it will lead to an ultimately greener and more efficient future, and end the reliance on a finite resource.

					<p>
						This doesn’t mean the legacy of the petrol car will end so abruptly. Thanks to companies and auto shops such as <a href="https://www.totemautomobili.com" target="_blank">Totem Automobili</a> and <a href="https://lunaz.design" target="_blank">Lunaz</a>, classic cars can be conserved through conversion into an electric vehicle. Through a full restoration of the original car, followed by the integration of a new electric powertrain and motors, blasts from the past easily become luxurious and high-tech. The Totem Automobili GT Electric is an example of this, with the stunning body of an Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GT and a battery pack producing 590 hp underneath the hood. This means it can accelerate from 0-100 km in a staggering 2.9 seconds (as claimed by Totem). This might be the best compromise for classic car lovers, blending together the bests of both worlds and conserving car culture for the future. Here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmHd1A6eOXk" target="_blank">cinematic</a> covering every inch of this gorgeous masterpiece.
