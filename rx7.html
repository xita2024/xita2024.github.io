					<p>
						Anyone who has at least some knowledge of car/pop culture will have heard the term “JDM”. This refers to the Japanese domestic market, basically cars that were first manufactured in Japan. Appearing in popular films such as 2 Fast 2 Furious and Initial D, they are highly sought after vehicles as importing them is not easy. They are often modified, both for aesthetic and performance purposes, and many third party companies also create special body kits for certain models. Many of these cars were featured in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC), where many modified Japanese sports cars go head to head against each other. 2 companies that make these kits for the Rx7 are Fujita Engineering (FEED) and RE Amemiya, both which are featured in the epic clip of a touge competition below. Touge (峠) is a Japanese word for "pass", referring to the narrow and winding mountain roads where these street-racing competitions are commonly held.
