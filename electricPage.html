					<p>
						Anyone who has read the news recently would know the name Elon Musk. He is a visionary trying to send men to Mars, an avid user of <a href="twitter.html">Twitter</a> (he actually did it... For context, 10% of his shares was worth around $20 billion at the time of the post), the richest man on this planet, and is also the CEO of Tesla. While Elon Musk is neither the inventor of electric cars nor was he the first to try to make an electric car, Tesla created the first high end electric cars, blending the battery and its high-end technology with luxury. They also function without destroying the atmosphere of our planet. One might ask, “If electric cars are so great, why don’t we see more of them?” Well, it’s a simple supply and demand problem. While there is a huge demand for electric vehicles, Tesla doesn’t have the manufacturing capacity to supply that demand, resulting in higher prices. So, are many electric vehicles worth their higher price tag?

				-  Electric Motors: Thanks to being powered by a battery, electric vehicles produce almost 0 carbon emissions, provided charging is done with a renewable energy source, such as solar, hydro, or wind power. There are some emissions produced during the charging process, but they are minimal and are definitely much lower than emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuel. Charging is also a lot cheaper than buying gasoline, with public charging points islandwide and many more planned. Electric vehicles also don't require as much maintenance, unlike combustion ones as there aren't many moving parts in battery powered motors, creating more savings. Furthermore, many countries also provide incentives such as rebates and tax credits when you choose electric cars. Going electric brings many financial and environmental benefits. 
<br> 
<br>
				-  Speed: Contrary to what the heavier bodies of electric vehicles might suggest, they are actually REALLY fast. In fact, the 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid, Tesla’s latest and highest performance model, boasts the fastest acceleration of any production car, with a 0-60mph (0-100kmh) of just 2 seconds and a top speed of 200mph (320kmh). This is comparable to million dollar hypercars such as the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 918 Spyder, both which achieve 0-60 in under 3 seconds, already an impressive feat. How does a USD$130,000 (around SGD$180,000) electric family sedan beat million dollar hypercars built specifically to go fast? This is once again thanks to its electric motors, which produce 1020 hp and 1050 lb-ft of instant torque, providing instant acceleration. Gas engines need time for the turbines to start spinning, resulting in a little time lag before it can start producing the optimal power at the correct RPM. This applies to every electric vehicle, and is the reason why many electric cars can beat gasoline ones from a standstill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qen0ZlZM0ZA" target="_blank">Here</a> is an in depth review of the Tesla Model S Plaid.

				-  Lack of range: Being battery powered is also one of the electric vehicle’s biggest drawbacks. The electric motors have a limited range, making long distance drives much more inconvenient. An average electric car has a range of around 200 - 250 miles (320 - 400 km) per full charge, while a gasoline powered one can easily have twice that range. In Singapore, a developed urban city, this might not be much of a problem as daily commute is pretty short. In fact, you can cover most of the island in around 200 kilometers. However, in many other places in the world, such as Canada, the round trip for a work commute can be up to 200 kilometers, especially if you are commuting from a rural area to a major city. This will already have consumed most or all of your power, leaving your options for other activities that require driving limited. This is further applicable if you plan to take long road trips. Before COVID-19 hit, my family once drove from Toronto to New York City, a distance of around 790 kilometers, which took around 8 hours (not accounting stops for meals, etc). This would have taken much longer in an electric vehicle as we would have to take frequent charging breaks. As technology advances, the range will surely increase, but until then, the petrol engine has the advantage. Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mGBOIMvv_M" target="_blank">clip</a> from an episode of “The Grand Tour”, featuring a battle between gas and electric hatchbacks. 

<br> 
<br>
				- Long charging times: Further adding to the inconvenience is the long charging times that most electric vehicles face. Unlike petrol cars, where you can easily find a gas station and fill up your car with gas in 5 minutes, fully charging an electric car can take from several hours to even a full day, depending on the power and connector used for charging. Sometimes, it is even a challenge to find a place where you can charge it. Even the fastest Tesla superchargers need from 15-25 minutes, and although that sounds a lot faster, it is still significantly slower than filling gas. Luckily, you can use your Tesla as a game console to play games or watch movies on your entertainment screen while it is charging, utilising your real steering wheel in a video game, just like in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoZKXlsJG8" target="_blank">video</a>. However, when coupled with the shorter ranges, electric vehicles are definitely more of a hassle to drive daily, especially if you run of charge when you are in a hurry. Again, as technology improves, the charge time will greatly decrease, and maybe one day even be as quick as filling up gas. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAoFCW2INHQ" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video documenting a 1000 miles (1600 km) road trip in a Tesla.
